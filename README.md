#### Things to do after cloning the repo
1. Create a new branch and work in this branch

2. run `npm install`

  Intalls the dev dependencies

3. run `gulp`

Running these two commands will install the dev dependencies mentioned in package.json. It will also launch the site with a localhost. 

*Note: Both the commands might take several minutes to execute.*

4. Now edit and save. The browser will refresh itself automatically.

#### Things to do after making changes

5. run `gulp clean`

  It will clean the dist folder, including the image cache. 
  
  To only delete the dist contents and keep the images run `clean:dist`

6. run `gulp build`

  This will rebuild the `dist` folder.
  
7. Add, commit and push changes of your branch to git

  *Note: Do not merge your branch with the master as conflicts might arise. Instead create a pull request(Hint; Create pull request from the github repository page)*
